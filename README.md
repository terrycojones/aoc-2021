## Advent of Code 2021

Here are some solutions (or attempted solutions) to the [2021 Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) puzzles.

Scripts in each day directory can be run via:

``` sh
$ ./1.py < input.txt

# Or, for shell scripts
$ ./1.sh < input.txt
```

Use `2` instead of `1` for the second puzzle of the day.

The example input (as given in the puzzle description) for each day is in
`test.txt`.

The input I had to solve for is in `input.txt`.
